Words that have magic
Because of the discovery that
Someone else has needed to use them long before I saw that I did:
Staircase wit (everyone's favorite)
And expat (because it meant others had left,
Never coming back).

Expat. It started with the first epiphany;
There are a lot of places.
A simple recognition
To be sure
But one that could lead to
The second lesson:
You could LIVE in all these places.
Not all at once of course.
This isn't a cheesy mimicking of
A cheesy movie, of a walk to remember
That led to many places all at once.
No.
This was something new, something different.

And then a few years later
I learned about Paris in the 50's
And was crestfallen to realize
New is no longer new.

But the word
(Expat, in case you've forgotten already, although I haven't)
Is still magical.
